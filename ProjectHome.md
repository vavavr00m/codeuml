Codeuml is a web based UML designer where you code the diagram using a special language and it generates the diagram on the fly. It is quicker and faster than using any visual designer where you have to drag & drop diagram elements and use mouse to connect them. Codeuml uses the open source plantuml engine to produce diagram from text. You can produce UML diagrams as fast as you can code.
